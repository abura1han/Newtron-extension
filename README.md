## How to use it?
It's so easy to use it. Just move your cursor to the bottom of the status bar. You will have a row resize cursor. Then resize it and make it bigger. Boom ðŸ’¥ you have opened the Newtron editor. <br />
Now take a look at the left of the editor. You will find `notes & todos`. Currently we have two apps there. Now you can use them. It will make your life easy.
